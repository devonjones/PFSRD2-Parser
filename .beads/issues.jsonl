Each issue will be fixed one-by-one with testing on all equipment types (weapons, armor, shields, siege_weapons) to see what breaks.\n\nGoal: Make the code fail fast and loudly when invariants are violated instead of hiding bugs with defensive checks.\n\nCategories:\n- Critical (P0): 3 issues - Type checks, config hiding, default params\n- High (P1): 5 issues - Empty checks, duplicated code, silent returns  \n- Medium (P2): 6 issues - Try-except, complex conditionals\n\nTesting protocol for each fix:\n1. Apply fix\n2. Run full test suite on weapons, armor, shields, siege_weapons\n3. Document what breaks (if anything)\n4.
