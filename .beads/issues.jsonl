{"id":"PFSRD2-Parser-bcl","title":"Implement siege weapons parser","description":"Add siege weapons as a new equipment type to PFSRD2-Parser. Parse siege weapon HTML files with stats (Price, Usage, Crew, Proficiency, etc.), defensive stats (AC, Fort, Ref), item hitpoints (HP, Hardness, Immunities), and action sections (Aim, Load, Launch, Ram). Actions may have attack-like properties (damage, range, saving throws). Must also parse item level (like 'Item 1').","design":"Following the extensible equipment architecture pattern from weapons/armor/shields. Key implementation steps:\n1. Schema: Renamed shield_hitpoints to item_hitpoints, added protection/protections defs for immunities support (DONE)\n2. Equipment.py: Created _normalize_item_hitpoints() with immunities parsing from creatures pattern (DONE)\n3. Equipment.py: Added siege_weapon configuration to EQUIPMENT_TYPES with recognized_stats mapping (DONE)\n4. Need to implement: _normalize_defensive_stats() for AC/Fort/Ref parsing\n5. Need to implement: _normalize_speed() for speed field\n6. Need to implement: Action section parsing (Aim, Load, Launch, Ram) using extract_action_type from pfsrd2.action\n7. Need to implement: Attack parsing for Launch actions (damage, range, DC, burst)\n8. Need to implement: Item level parsing ('Item 1' format)\n9. Schema: Add siege_weapon_object definition\n10. Test on all 32 HTML files","notes":"COMPLETED: Full siege weapon parser implementation.\n- Schema: item_hitpoints with immunities, siege_weapon_object definition, speed_with_modifiers\n- Equipment.py: siege_weapon config in EQUIPMENT_TYPES, _siege_weapon_section_pass, _extract_siege_weapon_stats (handles multi-\u003chr\u003e layout), _extract_action_sections (parses Aim/Load/Launch/Ram with action costs), normalize_siege_weapon_fields  \n- Parsing: item level from h1, all stats (usage/crew/proficiency/ammunition/space/ac/fort/ref/hardness/hp/immunities/speed), actions with action_type, traits, source, price\n- Normalization: defensive stats, speed with modifiers, item_hitpoints with immunities, immunities parser\nTESTED: Successfully parses Bombard (ID 12) with all fields correctly structured.\nNEXT: Test on remaining 31 files to identify edge cases, validate schema passes, create unified runner script.","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2026-01-13T06:32:21.803545679Z","updated_at":"2026-01-13T06:48:10.422100884Z"}
